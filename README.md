# Pong Game

Welcome to my rendition of the Classic Game of Pong! This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Introduction

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, and this version is a modern take on the classic. The game is designed to be simple yet fun, providing a *nostalgic experience* for players of all ages.

## Features

- Single-player mode against AI
- Two-player mode for local multiplayer
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Pong.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Pong
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the left paddle up and down.
- Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
- The game starts automatically when you open the page.
- The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.
